*User experience and implementation*

Analysis of coded user feedback explores possible reasons why the dashboard scored well (Supplementary Table X). Many users highlighted the ‘clarity’, ‘usefulness’ and ‘variety’ of graphs and figures [M1, C3, C4, R1, R6, R7, R10, R12]. Others commented on dashboard interactivity [R6, R8], in particular the use of drill-down features as being particularly positive. Some users found that the dashboard would help with auditing and research. In particular they found that it gave important insights ‘into previously inaccessible big-data’ [R1], that it highlighted ‘areas of improvement for staff allocation’ [C3], suggested ‘directions for more focused audit and research’ [C5] and that it demonstrated ‘why we need to liaise with local referring sites’ [R3]. A few users commented on the AI implementation and time-series forecasting functions stating that it would be ‘useful in anticipating demand’ [R1], and that it ‘could be implemented easily’ [R8] but ‘unsure how it would be applied day-to-day’ [R12]. Some users did express concerns about dashboard access in the department [C1, C2],  whereas others thought there should be additional functionality to ‘export data’ or review it in more detail [R2,R11].
